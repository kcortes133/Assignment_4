# Purpose: Calculate gene score of each gene in input file. Gene score is defined as the
#   amount of edges it contributes to a subnetwork that consists of one gene chosen from each loci
#   gene scores are then averaged to get one gene score. This score indicates relative connectivity to
#   genes in other loci


# Calculate gene scores for each gene for each subnetwork
# Assumption: each gene only appears once in one locus
# genes cant be connected to themselves
# @param lociSubNs: List of dictionaries of subnetworks
# @param lociLists: list of list of genes separated by loci
# @param interactions: dictionary of genes and their edges
# @returns geneScores: dictionary of genes and the list of gene scores calculated from each subnetwork
