# Gene Score and Prix Fixe Subnetwork Visualization

## Goal
Uses a genetic algorithm to create densely connected subnetworks of genes.

## Description
Input is two tab-delimited files named 'Input.gmt' and 'STRING.txt'. Input.gmt is a 
tab-delimited file formatted as Broad Instituteâ€™s Gene Matrix Transformed (GMT). STRING.txt 
is a version of the STRING database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. 
Each line in the string file represents an edge in the network between the protein genes 
formatted protein'\t'protein'\t'weight'\n' where weight is the strength of their functional 
similarity.

Gene scores are calculated for each gene specified in the input file. Gene scores represent the 
relative connectedness each gene has to other genes in different loci. These scores are calculated by
the number of edges a gene adds to a randomly generated prix fixe subnetwork and averaged for all subnetworks.
A prix fixe subnetwork is a network with one gene from each loci.

A genetic algorithm is used to create more densely connected subnetworks. The genetic algorithm was composed of 
two main parts, the mutation, and the mating step. Each subnetwork was mutated such that each gene had a 5% chance 
of being mutated. If mutated the new gene was chosen from the same loci as the original gene. During the mating 
step each network was mated with a different one, with networks with higher density being chosen with higher 
probability. Selection probability corresponds to edge weight such that each network had a chance of being chosen 
equal to the total edge weight multiplied by 10. I multiplied the edge weights by 10 because most of the edge weights 
were below 1 so this would give higher probability to the more connected graphs. In this way the degree of connectivity 
of the network is directly proportional to the probability of the network being picked. The genetic algorithm was 
stopped once the change from the previous to current edge density was less than 0.5%. 

Networks can be visualized to show either the n genes with the highest gene scores or the n genes with the highest 
scores regardless of loci. They are visualized such that color represents loci of gene, size
represents the gene score (bigger node means higher score), edges are from the STRING database with the darkness
corresponding to the weight of the edge. The corresponding gene names, loci, gene scores from the visualized network 
are the output to a specified file.

    # make graph with specified genes
    # 1. gene score - size of node
    # 2. loci of gene - color of node
    # 3. weight of edge - darkness of edge
    # make network between loci genes no edges between genes in same loci
    graph = networkVisualization.makeGraph(visualNetwork, lociLists, geneAvg)
    networkVisualization.visualizeGraph(graph, topGenes)

        for subCoF in coFSubnetworks:
            popD += statistics.calcEdgeDensityW(subCoF)
        coFPopDensities.append(popD/len(coFSubnetworks))

    # calculate the avg of each population -> makeCoFSubnetorks is one population?
    # calculate the pvalue
    # probability edges using cof distribution is greater than avg of loci edged divided by # of random networks

    pval = statistics.empiricalPVal(newPop, coFPopDensities)
